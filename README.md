## CPE Term Project: A Smart Alarm System that Wakes You Up
### by John Abanes, Druce Chua, and Sri Pranav Srivatsavai

## Brief Description 
This is a smart alarm clock that can be strapped to your wrist when you sleep. You set an alarm time and a buffer time. For example, let's have an 8-hour alarm with a 15-minute buffer time. You input these, strap it to your wrist, and go to sleep. During the last 15 minutes of your alarm, it will begin recording movement. This is because, on a very rudimentary level, the more you move, the shallower your sleep is. Waking up in a deep stage may cause grogginess and so the alarm will instead wake you up when it detects a lot of movement. If it doesn't detect much movement, then it will just wake you up when the 8-hour mark is reached, so as to not ruin your schedule. It will then launch a simple cognitive game to serve as a brain exercise to further wake you up (and prevent you from simply turning it off and going back to sleep!). Below is an image containing all the screens in this project.

## User Manual
To run this program, an M5Stack Core 2 is needed (no other peripherals required). Make sure to install the drivers and other necessary software that allows the core to run Arduino code. More information can be found here: [Core 2 Setup](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/quick_start/core2/arduino). 

After doing the setup above, simply download the Rooster directory which should have the source file and the sound data file. Compile it using your Arduino IDE and execute it using the core. If all goes well, that should be it and your smart alarm system should be ready! The features in the core are self-explanatory and most screens have a back button as well.
